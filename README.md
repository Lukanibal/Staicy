**Staicy**

She's my personal *ass*istant bot.  
She is still under development as I learn python to make her specifically.  
Here are some tools that help her work:  
She uses [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) for her discord bits.  
Her `/news` command uses [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io)  
Her `/search` command uses [Google's custom search api](https://developers.google.com/custom-search)  
Powered by Gemma3:4b via [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and Stable-Diffusion 1.5 via [Comfy UI](https://www.comfy.org/)  


Her Commands so far:
-
`/guide` shows a helpful guide in discord for how to use her.  
`/tts <text>` will make her say what you type using VibeVoice via ComfyUI(not included in this repo, but linked above!)    
`/imagine <prompt>` will have her paint a picture using Stable Diffusion 1.5 via ComfyUI.  
`/search <query>` will search Google and return the top 3 results, embedding the first one.  
`/news <query>` will return the first result for the news query, and embed it.
