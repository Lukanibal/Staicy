**Staicy**
-
She's my personal *ass*istant bot.  
She is still under development as I learn python to make her specifically.  
Here are some tools that help her work:  
She's built with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), as all of my bot children are.  
She uses [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) for her discord bits.  
Her `/news` command uses [NewsData.io](https://newsdata.io)  
Her `/search` command uses [Google's custom search api](https://developers.google.com/custom-search)  

PLANS
-
I plan to make Staicy able to do the following things at least:  
✔️ set reminders  
✔️ do web searches  
- see/read images  
- maybe generate text documents?
