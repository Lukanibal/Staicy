**Staicy**
-
She's my personal *ass*istant bot.  
She is still under development as I learn python to make her specifically.  
  
She's built with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), as all of my bot children are.  




PLANS
-
I plan to make Staicy able to do the following things at least:  
- set reminders  
- do web searches  
- see/read images  
- maybe generate text documents?
